A little background on the case study. This data belongs to a loan aggregator agency which connects loan applications to different financial institutions in attempt to get the best interest rate. They want to now utilise past data to predict interest rate given by any financial institute just by looking at loan application characteristics.

To achieve that , we have decided to do a POC with a data from a particular financial institution. The data is given in the file "loans data.csv".
